# Groovy Podcast Ep. 6

Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening wherever you are. Today is ... February. Welcome to episode 6 of the Groovy Podcast with me, Peter Ledbrook, ...me, Ken Kousen, ... and me, Baruch Sadogursky.

## News items

In the new Groovy 2.4.0 release, I've been trying out the Android support. Adding Groovy is easy enough, and I've also added the SwissKnife project https://github.com/Arasthel/SwissKnife to a demo app.

I also think we should review news sources for Groovy info:
- Groovy Weekly mailing list, http://groovy-lang.org/groovy-weekly.html
- Jacob Mikkelsen's Grails Diary, http://grydeske.net/news/show/81
- Stack Overflow
- Groovy user's mailing list

Also need to talk about the Grails 3.0.0.M1 release:
- Standalone mode
- Functional tests with Geb
- Gradle now used for all scripts
- YAML in config files
- init dir has Application.groovy --> spin up app in IDE (from Spring Boot)
- can run war file using java command from command line
